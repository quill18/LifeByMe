Intensity & Difficulty Guidelines: {intensity_guidelines}

Character's Memory History, in chronological order:
{memories_json}

Make sure the player is experiencing a variety of different events, while also sometimes revisiting previous plot points - especially if they are important, life-affecting moments.

Story Guidelines:

1. Incorporate {name}'s traits naturally:
   - Primary traits (Curiosity, Discipline, Confidence, Empathy, Resilience, Ambition) range from 0 to 100
   - Higher trait values represent greater development in that area and should have a stronger influence on story options
   - Secondary traits also range from 0 to 100 and represent more specific characteristics
   - Actions that align with a character's traits represent their natural response but may lead to stagnation
   - Actions that challenge a character's current traits are more stressful but provide opportunities for growth

2. Consider stress levels:
   - Current stress affects emotional reactions
   - High stress (>70) makes challenges more dramatic. When highly stress, consider offering options that represent a "mental breakdown" inline with a character's traits that might provide a large stress relief even at the cost of a negative outcome to the story. (e.g. a high school student deciding to blow off studying for an exame to play video games instead)

3. Story elements should:
   - Feel natural and age-appropriate
   - Consider the character's life stage and circumstances
   - Occasionally provide options for romance, making sure they are age-appropriate (also consider the Intensity level.)

4. Create opportunities for:
   - {name}'s character growth
   - Relationship development
   - Secondary trait development (secondary traits represent: more specific personality traits like 'integrity' or 'artisticness', skills like 'cooking skill' or 'video game skills', and interests/preferences like 'coffee lover')

5. Limit the story text length of each beat to a single short paragraph. Make sure the story_text doesn't include the options

6. Stories will occur over three beats, representing a beginning, middle, and conclusion"""

Available Characters, in JSON format:
{characters_json}
   
Story Beginning Guidelines:
- Start with a clear, immediate situation
- Choose zero, one, or two characters to include in this story from the list of Available Characters. Make sure they are appropriate for the scene, setting, and time of day. Consider if you should include close friends or if the story should include less close or even antagonistic characters. It could even be time for a scene with no characters other than {name} by themselves.
- It's okay for some characters to have bad reactions to the player and for the player to fail in some ways. That is more realistic and makes for a more interesting game. Consider Difficulty, Intensity, current Stress, AND RECENT MEMORIES to help determine how positive or negative the event should be, aiming for variety
- Vary between locations (School or Work vs Home, maybe even a friend's home, restaurant, mall, and other locations appropriate for the player's life stage - or relevant to the users personality and interests)

Your response must use the provided function to return:
- A clear story_text describing the initial situation. If {name} is highly stressed (> 70), the situation should reflect that and feel more challenging.
- Separate from the story_text, also return 4 distinct response options that {name} could take. Make options feel meaningfully different and could lead the story in different directions. Include at least one option that correlates to {name}'s personality and at least one option that conflicts with {name}'s personality.
- DO NOT mentioning the options in the main story_text as it would be redundant{custom_story_seed}"""

# Additional prompt text for continuing a story
STORY_CONTINUE_TEMPLATE = """
Characters in this story, in JSON format:
{characters_json}

Story Continuation Guidelines:
- React naturally to the player's choice
- It's okay for some characters to have bad reactions to the player and for the player to fail in some ways. That is more realistic and makes for a more interesting game. Consider Difficulty, Intensity, and current Stress to help determine how positive or negative the outcome is
- Consider whether the player's choice is inline or divergent from their personality

Your response must use the provided function to return:
- A clear story_text describing what happened based on the previous choice made
- Separate from the story_text, also return 4 distinct response options that {name} could take. Make options feel meaningfully different and could lead the story in different directions. Include at least one option that correlates to {name}'s personality and at least one option that conflicts with {name}'s personality.

Character's Memory History, in chronological order:
{memories_json}

Guidelines for Memory Generation:

1. Memory Creation:
   - Generate a concise but meaningful title
   - Write a clear, specific description that captures the key moments
   - Importance (1-3) should reflect how much this event matters to {name}. 1=dealing with typical life events (e.g. going to a party, completing a homework assignment). 2=a significant change in {name}'s life (e.g. winning a major award, making a new friend). 3=a critical, life-changing event (e.g. death of a friend, first kiss)
   - Permanence (1-3) should reflect how long this memory will matter. 1=short term, only matters for the current year. 2=matters throughout the current life stage. 3=permanent core memory, never forgotten. Err towards shorter Permanence unless it really matters.
   - Tags should be specific and meaningful

2. Trait Change Guidelines:
   - Focus on the player's choices for their character. Consider if the player made choices that were inline with or in opposition to their current traits.
   - Consider one or two primary traits (Curiosity, Discipline, Confidence, Empathy, Resilience, Ambition) that were most significant in the scene.
   - Primary trait changes cannot exceed +10 or -10
   - Consider creating or modifying one or two secondary traits. Secondary traits represent more specific personality traits like 'integrity' or 'artistic', skills like 'cooking skill' or 'video game skills', and interests/preferences like 'coffee lover'. Be creative but contextual.
   - Secondary trait changes also cannot exceed +10 or -10
   - Stress changes can range from -50 to +50. Consider the choices the player made, their risk level, and how much they diverge from the character's traits. Decisions counter to the player's personality traits should generate more stress, even if the event was resolved successfully. The player's current stress is {current_stress}%.
   - Account for the difficulty & intensity settings

3. Tag Selection:
   - Emotional tags should reflect the character's feelings
   - Context tags should capture the situation and setting
   - Story tags should identify the type of experience (e.g., "coming of age", "first love", "personal triumph")

4. Changes to Characters:
   - For any characters involved in the story, provide updated character descriptions that reflect how this interaction affected them
   - Be especially certain to update relationship_description if there has been any change or development in the relationship with the player 
   - It's okay for some characters to have bad reactions to the player. That is more realistic and makes for a more interesting game
   - IMPORTANT: When referring to characters in character_changes, use their exact ID from the Characters list above

Process the story and create a memory that captures both what happened and how it affected {name}."""

# Template for initial cast generation
INITIAL_CAST_TEMPLATE = """You are a life simulation game's story generation system. Your role is to create engaging, contextually appropriate
story elements that feel natural and personal to the character. Use direct, active, language - preferring a simple and straightforward writing
style rather than flowerly or prosaic text.

Player Character Information:
{character_summary}

Intensity Guidelines: {intensity_guidelines}

Generate the initial cast of characters for {name}'s life. {name} is a {age}-year-old {gender} 
who just moved to a new town and is starting their Junior year (grade 11) at Quillington High School in a typical mid-size American city.
Create a cast including parents{sibling_text}, teachers, and classmates that {name} will meet on their first day. Consider the Difficulty and Intensity of the story when generating the cast of characters. Consider if familial relationships will be positive, or more complicated. Consider if the teachers will be more supportive/friendly, or more overworked/jaded. Classmates should be diverse in personalities and interests. Make some classmates more open to {name} and others less so, weighted by the game difficulty and intensity.

Character Guidelines:
1. Parents should feel like a realistic family unit with {name}. Depending on Difficulty & Intensity, this can range from more idealistic & supportive to complicated and tense.
2. Teachers should represent different subjects and teaching styles.

For relationship descriptions:
- Make sure to explicitly mention the base relationship. Example: "So-and-so is {name}'s mother." or "So-and-so is {name}'s classmate at Quillington High School."
- Parents/Siblings: Describe the pre-existing family dynamic. Note that {name} has {num_siblings} siblings.
- Teachers: Mention that this is {name}'s teacher, then specify that {name} has not yet met them, then describe how they will likely act upon first meeting {name}
- Classmates: Mention that this is {name}'s classmate, then specify that {name} has not yet met them, then describe how they will likely act upon first meeting {name}

All characters must have a first and last name. If the player character ({name}) doesn't seem to have a last name, invent one for their family members. Do not include titles (Mr/Ms/Dr) in names, not even for teachers."""
