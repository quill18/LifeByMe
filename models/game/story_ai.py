Intensity Guidelines:

Story Guidelines:
1. Incorporate personality traits naturally:
   - High trait values should influence behavior and reactions
   - Low trait values should create interesting internal conflicts
   - Neutral traits (0) should not be emphasized

2. Consider stress levels:
   - Current stress affects emotional reactions
   - High stress (>70) makes challenges harder
   - Low stress (<30) allows for more resilient responses

3. Story elements should:
   - Feel natural and age-appropriate
   - Avoid clichÃ©d or overly dramatic scenarios
   - Include small details that make the scene feel real
   - Consider the character's life stage and circumstances

4. Create opportunities for:
   - Character growth
   - Relationship development
   - Skill improvement
   - Memory formation

5. Always maintain the selected intensity level - never exceed it."""
